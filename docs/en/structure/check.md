# Structure Check

After structure migration, you can choose from two verification methods. One is the built-in checker provided by ape-dts, and the other is an open-source tool called [Liquibase](./check_by_liquibase.md). This document focuses on the built-in checker.

Structure check is independent of CDC. Here, `inline cdc check` refers to row-level data check
(see [data check docs](../snapshot/check.md)).

## Example: MySQL -> MySQL

Refer to [task templates](../../templates/mysql_to_mysql.md)

# Results

Structure check writes `miss.log` and `diff.log` as JSON Lines only when there are missing or
different objects. `summary.log` contains exactly one JSON line for the overall summary. When
`output_revise_sql=true` and repair SQL exists, it also writes repair statements to `sql.log`.
`sql.log` is plain SQL, one statement per line, with no JSON wrapper or schema/table/id metadata.

By default, stdout follows the normal runtime logging configuration. For orchestration paths that
need stdout to contain only check results, set `[runtime].check_result_stdout_only=true` for that
specific check task. In this mode, the files above remain the check artifacts, normal runtime stdout
is silenced, and miss, diff, summary, and SQL records are emitted to stdout as one line in the form
`<logger> - <payload>`. Only `summary_logger`, `miss_logger`, `diff_logger`, and `sql_logger` are
part of this stdout result stream. The JSON payloads are the same objects as the file logs; SQL
payloads are the same plain statements as `sql.log`.

`miss.log` and `diff.log` use the same JSON structure (`StructCheckLog`). `src_sql` and
`dst_sql` are optional and appear only when the corresponding side has a definition:

```json
{
  "key": "index.db_name.tb_name.idx_name",
  "src_sql": "source definition SQL",
  "dst_sql": "target definition SQL"
}
```

`key` identifies the structure object and is always present. Structure logs do not contain
`schema`, `tb`, `id_col_values`, `target_schema`, or `target_tb`. `src_sql` is included when the
source-side definition exists; `dst_sql` is included when the target-side definition exists.
Source-only missing objects usually have only `src_sql`; objects with different definitions have
both `src_sql` and `dst_sql`; target-only extra objects have only `dst_sql`.

The structure key has this format:

```text
<object_type>.<schema>.<table_or_object>[.<sub_object>]
```

Common table-scoped examples include `table.struct_check_test_1.not_match_column`,
`index.struct_check_test_1.not_match_index.i6_miss`,
`constraint.struct_check_test_1.not_match_missing.not_match_missing_pkey`,
`table_comment.struct_check_test_1.not_match_comment`, and
`column_comment.struct_check_test_1.not_match_comment.id`. PostgreSQL global objects use
object-specific keys such as `udt.schema.type_name`, `udf.schema.function_name(arguments)`, and
`rbac.role.role_name`.

- `miss.log` (present in source but missing in target)
```json
{"key":"table.struct_check_test_1.not_match_miss","src_sql":"CREATE TABLE `not_match_miss` (`id` int NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`))"}
{"key":"index.struct_check_test_1.not_match_index.i6_miss","src_sql":"CREATE INDEX `i6_miss` ON `not_match_index` (`c6`)"}
```

- `diff.log` (object definition differs, or the object exists only in the target)
```json
{"key":"index.struct_check_test_1.not_match_index.i1","src_sql":"CREATE INDEX `i1` ON `not_match_index` (`c1`)","dst_sql":"CREATE INDEX `i1` ON `not_match_index` (`c2`)"}
{"key":"table.struct_check_test_1.not_match_column","src_sql":"CREATE TABLE `not_match_column` (`id` int NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`))","dst_sql":"CREATE TABLE `not_match_column` (`id` bigint NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`))"}
{"key":"index.struct_check_test_1.full_index_type.index_not_match_name_dst","dst_sql":"CREATE INDEX `index_not_match_name_dst` ON `full_index_type` (`c1`)"}
```

- `summary.log` (overview of the check results)
```json
{"start_time":"2023-10-01T10:00:00+08:00","end_time":"2023-10-01T10:00:05+08:00","is_consistent":false,"miss_count":8,"diff_count":5,"skip_count":0,"sql_count":14,"tables":[{"schema":"struct_check_test_1","tb":"not_match_column","checked_count":0,"miss_count":0,"diff_count":1,"skip_count":0},{"schema":"struct_check_test_1","tb":"not_match_miss","checked_count":0,"miss_count":1,"diff_count":0,"skip_count":0}]}
```

- `sql.log` (generated when `output_revise_sql=true`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `struct_check_test_1`.`not_match_miss` (`id` int NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`));
```

# Scope

- Structure check compares the source structures selected by the configured routing and filters with the corresponding target structures.
- Extra objects that exist only in the target are reported in `diff.log`.
- Objects outside the selected databases/schemas and filters are not checked.
